# water_portability_index

# Objective

To understand what constitutes safe, potable water and distinguish between potable and non-potable water by applying machine learning techniques.

# Dataset

The dataset contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies.

ph: pH of water (0 to 14).

Hardness: Capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L.

Solids: Total dissolved solids in ppm.

Chloramines: Amount of Chloramines in ppm.

Sulfate: Amount of Sulfates dissolved in mg/L.

Conductivity: Electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm.

Organic_carbon: Amount of organic carbon in ppm.

Trihalomethanes: Amount of Trihalomethanes in μg/L.

Turbidity: Measure of light emitting property of water in NTU.

Potability: Indicates if water is safe for human consumption. Potable - 1 and Not potable - 0

# Models used for training

Support Vector Classifier - The objective of a Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier) is to fit the data you provide, returning a "best fit" hyperplane that divides, or categorizes your data.

Random Forest Classifier - A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
